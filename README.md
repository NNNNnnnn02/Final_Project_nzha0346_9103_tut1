# **Apple tree_Time Based**

## ** Project Overview **

### This is an interactive animation project based on p5. js, showcasing the complete lifecycle of an apple tree from growth to fruiting to apple drop. Based on our group assignment, I chose Time Based animation as my personal creative direction for this project.

## ** Interaction description **

### ** Auto-play : ** Upon opening the page, the apple tree will automatically commence its growth process (5-10 seconds).

### ** Restart : ** Press the spacebar to restart the entire growth process, generating a brand-new random apple tree each time.

### ** Gravity control : ** During the apple-falling phase, press the spacebar to toggle gravity direction (upwards/downwards).

## ** Personal Creative Realisation **

### ** Animation Drive Method **
### I selected time-based animation to drive my personal code, employing precise temporal control to simulate the natural growth process of trees.
